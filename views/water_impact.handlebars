            <h2>Water Footprint</h2>
            <p>What does water impact mean and how is it calculated?</p><br/>
            Everything we eat takes water to grow. The water use is divided into 3 categories: <p style="color:green;">green, </p><p style="color:grey;">grey, </p>and <p style="color:blue;">blue</p>.<br/>
            <p style="color:green;">Green water</p> is water that comes from precipitation and is stored in the soil and the plant's roots.<br/>
            <p style="color:blue;">Blue water</p> is freshwater both at the surface (rivers and lakes) and underground (water table).<br/>
            <p style="color:grey;">Grey water</p> is polluted water that has been contaminated with pesticides from agricultural runoff, or domestic activity like laundry.<br/>
            <br/>
            <p>How did we calculate the water impact?</p><br/>
            The value we display as the "Ethical Impact" for each ingredient is the average of the green, blue, and grey water values for that ingredient.<br/>
            <br/>
            <p>Why is it important?</p><br/>
            Knowing the water footprint of ingredients in the food you eat can help you make water-conscious choices about what you choose to cook with.<br/>
            Global freshwater reserves have been shrinking in recent decades, as population growth and increasing temperatures cause significant shifts in the availability of freshwater.<br/>
            Agriculture is one of the largest global drains on water, and by making choices to prioritize crops with a smaller water footprint, we can contribute to ethical water use in this area.<br/>
